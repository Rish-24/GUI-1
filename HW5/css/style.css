Assignment 5: Scrabble Board
Copyright (c) 2024 by Rish Dhir. All rights reserved. May be freely copied or

Assingment Description: In assignment we were required to build a srabble board game. I made the basic
version of the game by just implementing one strip of the game rather then the board. The board correctly
updates the score and the highest scores and the remaining tiles are tracked
